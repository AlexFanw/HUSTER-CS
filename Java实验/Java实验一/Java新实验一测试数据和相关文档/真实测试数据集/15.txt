
The release of the new James Bond film has been put back by seven months as coronavirus continues to spread.
The producers said they had moved the release of No Time To Die from April to November after "careful consideration and thorough evaluation of the global theatrical marketplace".
The announcement comes days after the founders of two 007 fan sites called on the film studios to delay its release.
